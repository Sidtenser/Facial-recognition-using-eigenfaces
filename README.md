# Facial-recognition-using-eigenfaces


The Eigenface Facial Recognition project is a computer vision application that utilizes Eigenfaces, a dimensionality reduction technique, to recognize and identify individuals based on their facial features. Eigenfaces are derived from an extensive dataset of facial images and serve as a compact representation of facial variations.
